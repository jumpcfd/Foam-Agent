"""Filesystem locations that Foam-Agent resolves at runtime.

The package lives at ``<root>/src/foamagent`` in a source checkout, while what it writes
(``runs/``) lives at ``<root>``.  Every module used to recompute that relationship from
its own ``__file__``, which silently broke whenever the package moved.  Resolve it in one
place instead, and let ``FOAMAGENT_ROOT`` override it for installs where the run directory
is not a sibling of the source tree.
